    .DESCRIPTION
        Query to update inventory table.
        It is checking if the row with particular DNSHostName already exist:
            - If yes then row is updated:
                Additionally query is checking if isActive status is changed from 0 to 1
                and the time difference between LastSeen date and current one.
                    * if both conditions are true than additional column (RecentlyStarted) is set to true
                    * if conditions are not met than existing fields are overwritten with new values
            - If no then new row is inserted
        Query is used in "Get-DeviceInventoryToMonitor.ps1" only.
        All INPUTS are replaced during query creation in PowerShell scripts.

    .INPUTS
        PRIMARY_KEY_VARIABLE - Column name which is used to identify particular row.
        TABLE_NAME_VARIABLE - Name of the table which is meant to be updated.
        COMPUTER_DNS_HOSTNAME_VARIABLE - Row identifier value.
        #Temp_TABLE_TEMPORARY_NAME_VARIABLE - Name of the temporary table used during this query execution only.
        COLUMNS_TO_COMPARE_DURING_UPDATE_VARIABLE - Names of columns which are taken under the consideration during comparison
        UPDATE_QUERY_BLOCK_VARIABLE - Standard update query block,
            which is generated in PowerShell scripts using custom function "Get-SQLupdateSection",
            from SQL.psm1 module located under path: ./Core/SQL/Module/SQL.psm1.
            Format:
                UPDATE TABLE_NAME_VARIABLE
                SET ColumnName1 = 'Value1', ColumnName2 = 'Value2', ColumnName3 = 'Value3'
                WHERE PRIMARY_KEY_VARIABLE = 'COMPUTER_DNS_HOSTNAME_VARIABLE'
        INSERT_QUERY_BLOCK_VARIABLE - Standard insert query block,
            which is generated in PowerShell scripts using custom function "Get-SQLinsertSection", 
            from SQL.psm1 module located under path: ./Core/SQL/Module/SQL.psm1.
            Format:
                INSERT INTO TABLE_NAME_VARIABLE (ColumnName1, ColumnName2, ColumnName3)
                VALUES ('Value1', 'Value2', 'Value3')

    .OUTPUTS
        None
