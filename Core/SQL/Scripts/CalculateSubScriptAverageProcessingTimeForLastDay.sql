/*
    .DESCRIPTION
        Query to calculate average processing time for each data retrieving script
        and fill in number of miliseconds to AVG_Processing_Duration_ms in LastExecution Table.
        Average is calculated based on similar time of the yesterday.

        It is Recommended to cover whole 24H. If @NumberOfHoursToAverage is set to 4, 
        than the script should be triggered 6 times a day (24 / 4 = 6)

        Get-RecentlyStartedDeviceDetails.ps1 is excluded as it is not run on a regular basis

    .INPUTS
        @NumberOfHoursToAverage - time range in hours based on which the average will be calculated

    .OUTPUTS
        None
