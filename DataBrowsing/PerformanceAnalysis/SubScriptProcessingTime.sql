    .DESCRIPTION
        Query to retrieve statistics related to triggered script in a given time frame.
        Output is presented as 3 tables:
            1. Average processing time based on the script type
            2. Average processing time for each script
            3. Average processing time for each script with the dispersion to number of processed devices

    .INPUTS
        @StartDate
        @EndDate

        To have an average for particular day, set:
            StartDate for the date from which you would like to get the average
            EndDate - StartDate + 1
        E.g. @StartDate = '2023-09-12', @EndDate = '2023-09-13',
        in such case all logs collected on 2023-09-12 will be included in average.

    .OUTPUTS
        Script_Name - Name of the script
        Type - Script type [Objects/Events/SyncData]
        Average Processing time - average script execution duration
        Number of executions - number of script executions within configured time frame.
        Remaining_Seconds_To_Next_Run - seconds to the next script run
        Average Number of processed devices - Average devices processed during selected time frame.
            (For first and second table ONLY)
        Processed_devices - Exact number of processed devices
            (For third table ONLY)
