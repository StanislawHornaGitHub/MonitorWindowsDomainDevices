    .DESCRIPTION
        Query to calculate average of values from Output per day for period selected in INPUTS

    .INPUTS
        @StartDate
        @EndDate

        To have an average for particular day, set:
            StartDate for the date from which you would like to get the average
            EndDate - StartDate + 1
        E.g. @StartDate = '2023-09-12', @EndDate = '2023-09-13',
        in such case all events collected on 2023-09-12 will be included in average.
