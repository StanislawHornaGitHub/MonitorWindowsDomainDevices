    .DESCRIPTION
        Query to retrieve average values for columns specified in OUTPUTS.
        Average is calculated based on events collected within time frame,
        which is configured in INPUTS variables.

    .INPUTS
        @StartDate
        @EndDate

        To have an average for particular day, set:
            StartDate for the date from which you would like to get the average
            EndDate - StartDate + 1
        E.g. @StartDate = '2023-09-12', @EndDate = '2023-09-13',
        in such case all events collected on 2023-09-12 will be included in average.

    .OUTPUTS
        Name - Device's Hostname without domain part
        DeviceModel - Model of the device
        CPU Temp C - CPU Temperature in Celsius
        Power Consumption - Power Consumption in Wats
        CPU usage % - Percentage of busy CPU time
        RAM usage % - Percentage of used RAM memory
        Disk usage % - Percentage of Disk activeness time
        Disk Read MB per s - Disk read speed
        Disk Write MB per s - Disk write speed
        Network Received Mbps - Network incoming traffic speed
        Network Sent Mbps - Network outgoing traffic speed
